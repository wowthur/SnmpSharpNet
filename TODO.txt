- Remove MutableByte where possible as linq already can do most of this inline.
- Helper function for "byte []" for IsNullOrEmpty() or IsNullOrShorterThan()
- Consider refactoring to var instead of explicit types during declaration to make changing return types easier
- Join IAuthenticationDigest.PasswordToKey implementations as they are very redundant
- 64-bit extension method to Random for AES-64 salt
- Better buffer endian solutions for 3DES and AES? (initialization vectors)
- Array deep copy extension methods (AES ExtendShortKey, maybe just use ToArray())
- Verify key parity for DES in PrivacyDES.Decrypt
- SNMPV3ReportError.TranslateError switch on equals
- AgentParameters() : this... what's the this do? base()?
- Buffer overflow/underflow exception generating template/generic (Ethernet address would benefit)
- IpAddress.IsIP() use regular expression
- OctetString.IsHex is questionable in quality
- OctetString.ToHexString() ... simple Linq solution is better
- OctetString.GetHashCode() ... maybe... maybe not
- OctetString.CompareTo and Equals ... lots of duplicate complexity... merge
- Oid Concat() - good for operator overload
- Oid Encode() - Probably will throw on null values... add test
- Oid Parse() - replace with a regex
- Eliminate extra protected value for properties and make them direct
- SecureAgentParameters.HasCachedKeys - clean a bit
- SNMPConstant.GetTypeName() - Problems with duplicate type values in select
- SNMPConstant.DumpHex() - More of a helper right?
- TrapPDU - Use linq for cloning
- UdpTransport.ReceiveFromCallback() - Consider stacked case statements for identical behavior
- IPAddress - Fix the helpers... they're ugly
